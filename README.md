## Notes

I had to make this app three times. The fist time I made my own keyboard and most of the functions were working except the change Editing functionality for the text box, Then I decided to use the built in keyboard so I rebuilt ebery thing. After every thing was done I wanted to commit my project but it would gave me an error, then I accidentally tried to pull so everything that I've done was gone. SO I TRIED ONE MORE TIME.
